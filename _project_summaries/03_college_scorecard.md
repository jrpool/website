<a href="https://medium.com/@USDigitalService/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc#.och6jmrcd">We launched College Scorecard with the Department of Education and 18F</a> to help students make more informed decisions about college selection. Millions of students have already benefited from this data, the most comprehensive and reliable ever published on employment outcomes and success in repaying student loans. By giving developers access to an API, we let them create more customized tools to help students find the right school.
